Version 2 of the Smart Factory Platform project. This version is a complete rewrite of the original project, with a focus on improving the architecture and design of the system.

## Overwiew
Smart Factory is an IoT opensource project whose main purpose is to monitor, verify, manage and control sensors, modules and smart devices in Smart City, Smart Environments and many others. This project was born from my passion for technology, microservices, cloud and internet of things.

In developing of this project, I'm going to use a lot of tools to understand and learn how to use them. I want to find the best solutions for the project.

The documentation is constantly improving.

I chose the microservice architecture for this project because IoT means Big Data and the system needs to be scalable, available and flexible.

If you want to contribute or/and learn, come on. The main purpose of this project is educational.
