# Smart Factory Platform
Smart Factory is an IoT opensource project whose main purpose is to monitor, verify, manage, control and maintain sensors, modules, devices and smart objects in Smart City, Smart Environments and many others. This project was born from my passion for technology, microservices, cloud and internet of things.

I chose the microservice architecture for this project because IoT means Big Data and needs to be scalable, available and flexible.

In developing this project, I will use a lot of tools to learn how to use them and to find the best solution for my use case.

The documentation is constantly improving and I will add new information when I develop a new function in the system.

If you want to contribute or learn, come on. The main purpose of this project is educational.
